# Development Strategy Overview

## Project Summary

My goal is to create a movie application using JavaScript, emphasizing a modular architecture. This involves breaking down the codebase into separate modules, each handling specific functionalities such as components, CSS, logic, and event handling.

## Approach to Development

- **Modularization**: Divide the project into modules, ensuring each module focuses on a single responsibility.
  
- **Modular Design Principles**: Encapsulate related functionalities within modules to enhance reusability and ease of maintenance.
  
- **Structured Codebase**: Maintain a well-organized folder structure to facilitate navigation and management of different module types.
  
- **Testing**: Incorporate unit tests for each module to validate functionality and identify issues early on.
  
- **Version Control**: Employ Git or a similar version control system to track changes and collaborate effectively.

## Types of Modules

Tasks for each user story will fall into distinct module categories:

`components`: Responsible for rendering user interface components.
`css`: Manages styling and layout.
`logic`: Implements business logic and data processing.
`handlers`: Controls user interactions and event management.

- Additional module types may be introduced as needed to accommodate project requirements.

## Conclusion

By adhering to a modular architecture and employing separation of concerns principles, i aim to develop a robust and maintainable flight schedule application in JavaScript.
